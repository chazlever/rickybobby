## Installation

### Dependencies

To run a pre-built binary, the only dependency is `libpcap`.  If you're running
on a Debian based distribution, you can install this with the following
command:

    sudo apt-get install libpcap
    
If you're planning on building from source, you will need a version of Go that
supports Modules (Go 1.11+). See the Go Wiki page on
[Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) for more information.

### Binaries

For installation instruction from binaries, please visit the [Releases
Page](https://github.gatech.edu/clever3/rickybobby/releases).

### Via Go

You can use the Go tool to download and install the binary for you.

    $ go get github.gatech.edu/clever3/rickybobby
  
Or you can manually clone the repository and build the binaries yourself.

    $ git clone https://github.gatech.edu/clever3/rickybobby.git
    $ cd rickybobby
    $ go build && go install

Each of the above methods will install the `rickybobby` binary into
`$GOPATH/bin`.

## Usage

To view the help documentation for the application, you can simply call the
application without any arguments.

    $ rickybobby
    NAME:
       rickybobby - Parsing DNS packets when you wanna GO fast!

    USAGE:
       rickybobby [global options] command [command options] [arguments...]

    VERSION:
       1.0.0

    AUTHOR:
       Chaz Lever <chazlever@gatech.edu>

    COMMANDS:
       pcap     read packets from a PCAP file
       live     read packets from a live interface
       help, h  Shows a list of commands or help for one command

    GLOBAL OPTIONS:
       --tcp                   attempt to parse TCP packets
       --questions             parse questions in addition to responses
       --questions-ecs         parse questions only if they contain ECS information
       --profile               toggle performance profiler
       --sensor value          name of sensor DNS traffic was collected from
       --source value          name of source DNS traffic was collected from
       --output-type value     where to output parsed traffic [stdout (default), kafka] (default: "stdout")
       --format value          output format of parsed traffic [json (default), avro] (default: "json")
       --config value          YML config file with kafka options
       --kafka-key value       (kafka) Key to use when sending data to Kafka
       --kafka-topic value     (kafka) Topic
       --kafka-username value  (kafka) Username for SASL authentication to Kafka brokers
       --kafka-password value  (kafka) Password for SASL authentication to Kafka brokers
       --kafka-brokers value   (kafka) List of Kafka brokers
       --help, -h              show help
       --version, -v           print the version
    The application is broken out into two different commands that affect where
    traffic is parsed from. More details on each of these commands is provided
    below.

Kafka options can also be configured using a YML file (see [config.example.yml](config.example.yml)). Note that command-line flags take precedence over file-based configuration options.

### Parsing PCAP Files

To view the help documentation for the `pcap` command, invoke the application
as follows:

    $ rickybobby pcap -h
    NAME:
       rickybobby pcap - read packets from a PCAP file
    
    USAGE:
       rickybobby pcap [file...]

As shown above, the `pcap` command takes one more more arguments where each
argument is simply a path to an uncompressed PCAP file. It is also possible to
parse from STDIN by pass `-` as the filename. 

The following shows an example of how you can parse a compressed PCAP using
STDIN:

    $ zcat compressed.pcap.gz | rickybobby pcap - 

### Parsing Live Interface

To view the help documentation for the `live` command, invoke the applicatijon
as follows:

    $ rickybobby live -h
    NAME:
       rickybobby live - read packets from a live interface
    
    USAGE:
       rickybobby live [command options] [interface]
    
    OPTIONS:
       --snaplen value  set snapshot length for PCAP collection (default: 4096)
       --promiscuous    set promiscuous mode for traffic collection
       --timeout value  set timeout value for traffic collection (default: 30)
       --format  value   set output format for parsed traffic (options: json, avro) (default: json)
       
As shown above, the `live` command accepts the name of an interface to parse
from as its sole argument. There are also a number of command specific flags
that can be set.

The following shows an example of how you can parse from `eth0` in promiscuous
mode.

    $ rickybobby live --promiscuous eth0
